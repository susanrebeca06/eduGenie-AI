🤖 Google Gemini Integration

Google Gemini acts as the generative AI engine of EduGenie.

The student's question is sent from the frontend to the Flask backend. The backend sends a suitable prompt to the Gemini model and returns the generated response to the user.

The project uses the Gemini API through the Python backend, and the API key is stored in an environment file rather than exposed in client-side code.

💻 Coding

1. Backend – "app.py"

import os
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from google import genai

load_dotenv()

app = Flask(__name__)

client = genai.Client(
    api_key=os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/ask", methods=["POST"])
def ask():
    data = request.get_json()
    question = data.get("question", "").strip()
